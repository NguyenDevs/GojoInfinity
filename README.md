## Experience:
- **Infinity** — Become untouchable! Anything approaching you slows down infinitely (inspired by Zeno's paradox), making attacks never reach you.
- **Hollow Technique: Purple** — The ultimate destructive force! Combine Blue and Red to fire an unavoidable purple sphere that obliterates everything in its path, creating a massive zone of imaginary mass erasure.
- **Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue** — Generate a blue cursed energy sphere that attracts all entities in a radius, dealing continuous damage. Target an entity to pull it straight to you, or aim at a block to place an attracting sphere there.
- **Cursed Technique Reversal: Red** — Unleash repulsive red cursed energy to blast all entities away in a radius, or target one entity to repel it forcefully.
